**PLANNING CLASSES**

Entity-Component:

entities can be players, enemies, doorTrigger, particles, etc.
each entity has a component such as a transform component like position, rotation, velocity, collider,sprite  etc.
Classes:

Entity:

- contains a list of components 
- update()
- render()

Component:

- Entity *owner
- virtual update()
- virtual render() 

EntityManager:

- holds list of entities, for each entity we update and render 
- addEntity(entity);
- getEntity(string entityName)
- update()
- render()

each component can have subclasses like transform, sprite, etc. that implement their own overloaded version of update() and render()
we also specify an owner for the component 
note that update() and render() are virtual since subclasses must implement those methods
